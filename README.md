# 📊 Task 2 – Customer Clustering with K-Means

This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.

---

## 🧠 Objective

Group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using **K-Means Clustering**.  
The clustering is based on features like:

- Annual Income
- Spending Score

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data handling
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn** – for K-Means clustering and scaling
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization

---

## 📂 Project Files

- `kmeans_clustering.py` – Main script that:
  - Creates sample customer data
  - Applies K-Means clustering
  - Visualizes customer groups and centroids

- `README.md` – Project overview and explanation

---

## 📈 Output Example

The final output includes:
- A scatter plot showing customer clusters in different colors
- Cluster centroids marked in yellow
- Logical grouping of customers based on their income and spending behavior
